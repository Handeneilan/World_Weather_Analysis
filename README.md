# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this project is to practice with APIs into a Jupyter Notebook. This analysis gave me chance to look at different weather patterns around the world and prepare a travel itinerary for who is interested to book a travel. I used both Open Weather's and Google Maps' APIs, and created statistical charts based on weather data, an interactive heat map with map markers, a map of cities with a nearby hotel with map markers, and a travel map showing routes from 4 different cities in Turkiye.
